## 🐼 About the Page
The website serves as both personal home page and blog, with several sub-pages. Here, I will keep sharing fresh **thoughts** and new **ideas** about my personal experience as well as practical **tutorials** on technologies, mainly bioinformatics-related issues (because I am studying **bioinformatics** 🧬!). Meanwhile, you can also spend your time on the **Gallery** and **Music** pages, where diverse pictures are displayed and sensational music are always ready to play! There are even more website features and fun facts about me to explore... Hope you enjoy your stay 😉.

Have a quick glance ⬇️

Great work starts from zero. The website is still under construction. I will try as much as possible to enrich the content and beautify its appearance, making the page meaningful to me, and to you.

## 🤝 Acknowledgement
The page's framework uses **hexo-theme-butterfly 5.5.3** as template. It is really a stunning design.
